# NEC PD SDK

Node.js library interface for communication via RS232 with NEC large-screen displays.

This library is a Node.js port of [NEC PD Python SDK](https://github.com/NECDisplaySolutions/necpdsdk). At the moment it doesn't implement the entire protocol, only functions that we needed for our project. Contributions are welcome.
